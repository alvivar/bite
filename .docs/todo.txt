    Get should read values using json instructions
    Set should transform json instructions into a value
    Parse message for nested jsons into instructions

    Push # value should insert into a list, transform normal values
    Pop # should return and delete a value

    Use time and IP on the server log
    Connection handles needs to be a module?
    Use a decent log system instead of println?

    I'm using the Cargo.toml dependencies correctly?

    Thread waiting for q! in the input to quit.
    Improve serialization so it can be written in blocks like a good BTreeMap on file?

    Auth

    DB file name by environment
    IP and port by environment
    SET without key, creates an empty key
    Use Error as results instead of unwrap
